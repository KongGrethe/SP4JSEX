Elaborate on how JSON or XML supports communication between subsystems, even when the subsystems are implemented on different platforms:

	JSON/XML supports communication between different subsystems because it is a standard that is agreed upon by different platforms.
	Just like the HTTP protocol is the same for eg. Java and php programs.

Explain the topics: AJAX and Same Origin Policy, and different ways to work around it:

	AJAX is a framework for JavaScript. AJAX makes it possible for a page to recieve data from the server and update the page without reloading of the entire page. 

	The Same-origin-policy is a security policy. With this policy, a web browser allows scripts contained in a first website to access data on another website, but only if both pages have the same origin. 
	An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. This policy prevents things like Cross Script Attacks(XSS).
